# VDO

The Visual Distribution Operator (VDO) management system helps
 Drupal 8 distribution maintainers manage the base code and logic for the
 work cycle of development with number of workspaces for custom profiles,
 sub-profiles on local development machines or servers.

Constructing your Linux development computer or servers with:

**Products**: Where we do maintain our custom distributions/profiles base code.
```
/var/www/html/products
```

**dev**: Where we do development, enhancements, and optimization work rounds
on the distributions/profiles.
```
/var/www/html/dev
```
**test**: Where we do testing and functional automated testing on
the distribution/profile.
```
/var/www/html/test
```

**demos**: Where we do all demos templates and default content work on
the distribution/profile.
```
/var/www/html/demos
```

**projects**: Where we do development on a project based on
the distribution/profile product.
```
/var/www/html/projects
```

**vdo**: Where we do keep our VDO the Visual DO manager.
Which you could have a domain points at it, like:
vdo.local or
vdo.devhub.company-name.com

```
/var/www/html/vdo
```
